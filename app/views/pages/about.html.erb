  <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    I'm Joshua Zink-Duda, a software engineer with over 9 years of experience primarily in backend development.
    I have worked with a variety of languages and frameworks, but I find the tools used are less important than what you do with them.
    I enjoy writing clean code and designing maintainable systems that have a positive impact on the world.
