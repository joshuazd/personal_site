  <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
  Iâ€™m Joshua Zink-Duda, a software engineer who thrives on tackling ambiguous systems and turning them into something clear and maintainable.
  I enjoy automating tedious processes, eliminating friction, and designing solutions that scale.
  What motivates me most is applying these skills to problems that matter and projects where good engineering creates a positive impact on the world.
